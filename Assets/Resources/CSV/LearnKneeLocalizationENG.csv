Element Name;Description
Rzepka kolanowa;It is a flattened triangular bone with rounded edges, incorporated into the quadriceps tendon and located at the lower end of the femur.
Kość piszczelowa;It is a bone with a structural function that forms the lower leg. It belongs to long bones. The distal end of the tibia forms the medial malleolus.
Kość udowa;It is the longest bone in the human body. Like any long bone, it consists of a shaft and two ends. On the back surface of the body there is a prominent rough line (linea aspera), composed of two lips: the medial one (labium mediale) and the lateral one (labium laterale). Downwards, both lips spread apart and limit the popliteal surface (facies poplitea). The medial lip ends at the bottom with the adductor tubercle (tuberculum adductorium).
Więzadło rzepki;"The patellar ligament connects it to the tibia. During the flexion and extension movements of the knee joint, the patella moves together with the tibia. When the knee is straight and the extensor muscles are tense, the lower part of the articular surface of the patella rests on the patella surface of the femur, the upper part lies above it; when the knee is bent, the patella moves down and back, lies in the groove between the two condyles of the femur and is immobilized. When the knee is straight and the muscles are relaxed, the patella can be moved sideways. Below the articular surface there is a convex rough area, the lower part of which serves as an attachment for the patellar ligament."
Więzadło krzyżowe przednie;It runs from the medial surface of the lateral condyle of the femur anteromedial to the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia.
Więzadło krzyżowe tylne;It runs from the medial surface of the medial condyle down to the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia.
Więzadło poprzeczne;The transverse knee ligament spans between the most forward points of both menisci, connecting them. It is a thin, round ligament, often inhibited in development. Sometimes it may be completely missing. It tightens when the joint rotates outwards.
Łąkotka przyśrodkowa;Semicircular, C-shaped. Attached to the anterior and posterior intercondylar area. Firmly attached medially to the joint capsule, and laterally - to the tibial collateral ligament, which limits its mobility
Łąkotka boczna;Almost completely circular. It attaches to the anterior and posterior intercondylar areas. It is not attached to the joint capsule, so it is more mobile than the medial meniscus
Kłykieć przyśrodkowy;The medial condyle of the knee, also called the medial tubercle or medial process, is an important anatomical structure within the knee joint. This is a bony protrusion located on the inside of the femur, close to the knee joint. The medial condyle is crucial to the stability and function of the knee joint
Kość strzałkowa;It is located on the medial side of the shin and is the longest bone of the skeleton after the femur. It has a triangular shape in cross-section. At the top, where it is involved in the formation of the knee joint, the bone thickens significantly, tapers downwards, and then widens again, although to a lesser extent than at the top. Like any long bone, it consists of a shaft and two ends
Powierzchnia stawowa piszczela;The articular surface of the tibia is concave and adheres to the corresponding articular surface of the femur. The shape of this surface is asymmetrical, which allows for certain limitations in the mobility of the knee joint, protecting it against excessive twisting.
Powierzchnia stawowa rzepki;That is, the posterior one, above the apex, is covered with a thick layer of hyaline cartilage. It is divided into two fields, the lateral field of which is larger than the medial one, both of these parts are divided by a longitudinally running hill. It corresponds to a longitudinal groove on the patella surface of the femur.
Powierzchnia stawowa strzałki;The flat sagittal articular surface is located on the lateral condyle of the tibia. The articular surface of the fibula is directed downwards, posteriorly and laterally and is adjacent to the articular surface of the head of the fibula.
Więzadło poboczne strzałkowe;It extends from the lateral surface of the femur to the so-called the head of the fibula and is responsible for the stability of the knee from the lateral side
Więzadło poboczne piszczelowe;It extends from the medial surface of the femur to the medial surface of the tibia, hence it is responsible for the stability of the knee joint from the medial side (i.e. from the inside).
Więzadło łąkotkowo-udowe tylne;The ligament attaches near the posterior attachment of the lateral meniscus. It runs upwards and medially posteriorly from the posterior cruciate ligament. It usually joins it, ending at its attachment to the inner surface of the medial condyle of the femur.
